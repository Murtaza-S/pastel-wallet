# Project Title: FastAPI Project

## Description
This project is a FastAPI application designed to provide a robust API for managing resources. It includes a structured folder layout for organizing routers, controllers, and database migrations.

## Folder Structure
- **source/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **main.py**: Entry point of the FastAPI application.
  - **routers/**: Contains API route definitions.
  - **controllers/**: Contains business logic for the application.
  - **migrations/**: Contains database migration scripts and configuration.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```
   uvicorn source.main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage
- Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/`.
- The root endpoint returns a greeting message.

## Database Migrations
- Migrations are managed using Alembic. Refer to the `source/migrations/README` for detailed instructions on how to create and apply migrations.

## API Endpoints
- Define your API endpoints in the `source/routers/__init__.py` file.
- Implement the business logic in the `source/controllers/__init__.py` file.

## Additional Information
- Ensure to configure your database connection in the `source/migrations/env.py` file.
- Consider implementing authentication and authorization as needed for your application.

## Questions to Consider
1. What database schema do you plan to use, and what tables will be included?
2. Do you have specific API endpoints in mind that you want to implement?
3. Are there any authentication or authorization requirements for your API?
4. What additional libraries or tools do you want to include in your project (e.g., CORS, JWT)?
5. Do you have a preferred structure for your controllers and routers, or should they follow a specific pattern?
